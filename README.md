## Netflix Stock Price Predictor

##### Project Background
 Ever since taking a Machine Learning course at my university, I knew it was something that I wanted to become skilled at. Not necessarily just to open up additional career pathways, but more because I genuinely find it fascinating. Programming and Mathematics are the two subjects that have stimulated the most curiosity and excitement for me, and Machine Learning is a field in which both of those subjects coincide. Furthermore, I love the idea of a machine being able to predict something (ideally accurately) thanks to the code that I've written. I felt, however, that the ML course I took did not develop my talents for it enough for me to be satisfied. Thus, I've made the decision to practice my Machine Learning skills outside of the classroom in an effort to better myself as a developer and as a thinker in general. Thank you for taking the time to have a look at the first of many Machine Learning projects I have decided to tackle.

 ##### Ideal Features
 - Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Clean Visualizations to Understand the Dataset
 - My own implementation of a Linear Regression Model
 - Stock Price Predictions to have an overall accuracy of > 90%
